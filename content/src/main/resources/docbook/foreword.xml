  <para>This is an early version of the second edition of Jakarta Commons
  Cookbook. I'm updating the content, and you might experience some problems
  with links between chapters and sections. Don't rely on any of the URLs in
  this book just yet, I'm currently renaming all of the sections and chapters
  so that every section has a reasonable URL. I'm also trying to find some
  interesting ways to link to related O'Reilly content using the new O'Reilly
  metadata interface that was just published by O'Reilly Labs. Stay
  Tuned.</para>
