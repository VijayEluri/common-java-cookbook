               <p>The Jakarta community and the larger community of the Apache Software
                  Foundation is committed to developing open source software. The
                  Apache Software Foundation is a nonprofit corporation registered in
                  Delaware that supports ongoing collaborative software development
                  according to a set of simple ideals: transparency, meritocracy,
                  consensus, and mutual respect. To learn more about the foundation,
                  start at the Frequently Asked Questions page on www.apache.org
                  (<code class="systemitem">http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html</code>).
                  Jakarta is a project under the Apache Software Foundation, and it is
                  managed by what is known as a Project Management Committee (PMC).
                  This committee manages a number of Jakarta subprojects including the
                  Jakarta Commons.
               </p>
               <p>The Jakarta community and Apache XML community both had tremendous
                  growth spurts from 1999 to 2003, with both projects becoming dominant
                  forces in open source Java. Tomcat, Struts, Xerces, Xalan, Ant,
                  Cocoon, and other projects were embraced by the larger community and
                  Java developed a very strong association with open source because of
                  the influence of Jakarta. Toward the end of this growth spurt, the
                  corporate structure of Apache required a certain level of oversight
                  and accountability, which could not be achieved in an umbrella
                  project like Jakarta with hundreds of committers. A decision was made
                  to encourage Jakarta subprojects to move toward smaller, more focused
                  PMCs. One of the first projects to leave Jakarta was Apache Ant, and
                  other projects such as Maven, Struts, and Log4j followed suit. This
                  new, more nimble approach to the structure of collaborative software
                  development avoids the creation of a management layer between project
                  participants and the PMC. Apache is making way for a new generation
                  of projects that will set the standard for open source Java,
                  including Geronimo, Pluto, Directory, Derby, and Axion. Be aware that
                  the structure of projects and subprojects in Jakarta is somewhat
                  fluid at the moment, and, as the situation evolves, certain
                  components could be split off into separate Apache projects.
               </p>
               <p>If you find the components in this book helpful, I encourage you to
                  take some time to observe the commons-dev developer mailing list. The
                  ASF is (mostly) transparent, and this means that the general public
                  has a window into the collaborative development process that is used
                  to create a large body of great software. I would encourage any
                  developer to take an interest in a piece of software and watch the
                  development process. Follow the decisions, releases, arguments,
                  flame-wars, and evolution of something like Jakarta Commons and you
                  can see for yourself what works and what doesn't
                  work. This is also a great way to keep yourself informed of the
                  changes and direction of certain projects.
               </p>
               <p>I don't intend to speak for this community, and,
                  honestly, no one can speak for a group as diverse as the one that has
                  formed around Jakarta Commons. I wanted to write this book to help
                  attract more people to the concept of Jakarta Commons and to take
                  some time to encourage people to think about how they could
                  contribute to that effort. If there are more people paying attention
                  to the software, Commons components will have higher quality, more
                  bug reports will be filed, and more people might take some time to
                  submit documentation patches. If you find Jakarta Commons (or any
                  other Apache software) useful, you should consider taking a little
                  bit of time to help a fellow user on the user mailing list or submit
                  documentation patches. If you find a typo or a bug, file a report on
                  Apache's Bugzilla installation (<code class="systemitem">http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla</code>) or Jira
                  installation (<code class="systemitem">http://issues.apache.org/jira</code>).
               </p>
               <p>There is always a need for greater unit test coverage, and any time
                  you find an inconsistency in code you should file a bug.
                  Contributions can come in many forms &#8212; answering user
                  questions, writing documentation, writing unit tests, submitting
                  patches, or providing feedback. All of these contributions help
                  sustain a living community. If you find yourself unable to
                  participate in the community, you can make a small (possibly
                  tax-deductible) donation to the Apache Software Foundation to help
                  offset the cost of infrastructure and bandwidth (<code class="systemitem">http://www.apache.org/foundation/contributing.html</code>).
