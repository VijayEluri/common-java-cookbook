               <p>In this book, you'll find information about a set of
                  libraries developed within the Jakarta Commons (also referred to as
                  "Commons"). Commons (<code class="systemitem">http://jakarta.apache.org/commons</code>) is a set
                  of small, popular components from the Apache Software
                  Foundation's Jakarta project. Ranging from the
                  elementary to the complex, many would consider some of these
                  libraries indispensable to any Java&copy; project. These
                  components are so widespread, they may already be on your classpath.
                  If you develop an application using Jakarta Struts, Apache Tomcat, or
                  Hibernate, you have Commons BeanUtils and Commons Logging in your
                  classpath. If you just installed Red Hat Enterprise Linux with the
                  default configuration, you've got Commons libraries
                  somewhere in <code class="filename">/usr</code>. If you downloaded
                  Sun's J2EE 1.4 SDK, you will have also downloaded
                  Commons Logging and Commons Launcher. While Jakarta Commons may be
                  everywhere, many are still unaware of the capabilities these
                  components provide.
               </p>
               <p>This book uses Jakarta Commons to focus on tactical implementation
                  details, answering such questions as: How do we parse XML? How do we
                  serialize beans? Is there an easier way to work with Collections? How
                  do we work with HTTP and keep track of cookies? The tactical is often
                  sacrificed for the strategic. Consider a complex J2EE system with a
                  solid, well-conceived architecture. The strategic (or high-level)
                  design appears reasonable from 40,000 feet, but as soon as you drill
                  into the details, you notice that every Servlet or JSP contains pages
                  upon pages of unmaintainable and unnecessary code because the
                  developers were not aware of some valuable time-saver like BeanUtils,
                  Collections, or the Digester. Or, worse, the developer may have spent
                  a week reimplementing most of the capabilities of Commons BeanUtils
                  even though BeanUtils was already in the classpath. Knowing what
                  Jakarta Commons has to offer often helps to inform decisions made at
                  the lowest level.
               </p>
               <p>Few application developers would consider writing a custom XML
                  parser, but developers will frequently write custom components that
                  duplicate freely available libraries. Take, as an example, a set of
                  static utility methods that seems to pop up in almost every complex
                  project. A common process such as reading a file to a
                  <code class="literal">String</code> may be refactored into a
                  <code class="literal">CommonFileUtils</code> class, or turning a DOM
                  <code class="literal">Document</code> into a set of beans may be accomplished
                  with a set of classes in some custom code. Jakarta Commons provides
                  solutions to both of these problems and many more, and reading this
                  book may help you to avoid unnecessary wheel reinvention.
               </p>
               <p>Many people know of these components in a general sense, but few have
                  the months or weeks necessary to sit down and read the relevant
                  tutorials, FAQs, blogs, and archived mailing lists associated with
                  each component. The amount of work involved in keeping up-to-date
                  with an array of open source communities is not trivial. This is why
                  I've tried to compact much of this information into
                  easily accessible recipes. These recipes were written to provide the
                  information you need to start using Commons in a few minutes, but the
                  Discussion and See Also sections give you an opportunity to dig
                  deeper into the motivation behind each Commons component if you need
                  more information.
               </p>
               <p>The tools introduced herein save you serious time and provide you
                  with a set of alternatives you may not currently be aware of. I wish
                  I had read a book like this five years ago; it would have accelerated
                  my learning and helped me to avoid some costly design decisions. Use
                  this text as you will; if you are only interested in Commons
                  Collections, you should be able to quickly familiarize yourself with
                  Collections by browsing <a href="jakartackbk-CHP-5.html" title="Chapter&nbsp;5.&nbsp;Collections">Chapter 5</a>. On the other hand, if
                  you are looking for a survey of some of the major projects in Jakarta
                  Commons, read this book from start to finish. Part structured
                  reference, part prose, the cookbook format lets you customize your
                  reading experience, and I hope this book is as interesting to read as
                  it was to write.

                           <p>Functors are a fundamental way of thinking about programming as a set
                              of functional objects. Commons Collections introduced predicates,
                              transformers, and closures, and functors, which can be used to model
                              control structures and loops. This chapter demonstrates how one would
                              apply functors to any program.

                  <p>Limited time and resources forced me to make some decisions about
                     which projects to include in this text. Projects like Velocity,
                     FreeMarker, and Log4J, while not Commons components, were included
                     because they fit the mold of a small, easily reusable component.
                     Other Commons components were not included in this book because they
                     were still being developed at the time of writing, or because a short
                     recipe would have been impossible without a detailed 30-page
                     introduction. Commons DbUtils, DBCP, Discovery, Jelly, Launcher,
                     Modeler, Pool, Primitives, Chain, and promising sandbox components
                     could fill another entire volume. Some projects, such as Jakarta
                     HiveMind, started as components in the Commons Sandbox only to be
                     promoted directly to subproject status of the Jakarta project.
                     Classification of projects and components in Jakarta can also be
                     somewhat arbitrary; Jakarta ORO and Jakarta RegExp would both seem to
                     be prime candidates for the Jakarta Commons, but they are both
                     subprojects of Jakarta. Other projects, such as Jakarta Commons
                     HttpClient, have recently been promoted to be subprojects of Jakarta,
                     leaving the Commons entirely. Think of this book as focusing on
                     Jakarta Commons with some other projects thrown in to liven up the
                     discussion. I apologize in advance if I left your favorite project
                     out.
                  </p>
                  <p>Writing a book about a series of frequently released components is
                     reminiscent of a game called whack-a-mole. Just when you finish
                     updating a chapter for a new release, another component has a
                     release. On average, one commons component is released every one or
                     two weeks; therefore, a few of the versions in this book may be
                     obsolete as soon as this book hits the shelves. In general, Jakarta
                     Commons makes a concerted effort to preserve backward compatibility
                     and keep a stable public interface. Lessons learned on Commons
                     BeanUtils 1.6 should remain applicable to Commons BeanUtils 1.7. If
                     you find that a more recent version of a component has been released,
                     you should download that more recent version and check the
                     Discursive site for updates related to this book.
